#summary Bookmarklet problems with IE

There is [http://h5o.googlecode.com/files/bookmarklet.for.ie.html a version of the bookmarklet] available, which will not be maintained, because of the following issues:

  * *Maximum "URL" length (2kb)* which makes it very hard to actually implement anything reasonable
    * Obviously, it could be used as a remote JS include, but that wouldn't be very safe for you to use, with potential cookie sniffing and things, would it now?
  * *Incomplete support for HTML5* which means that the bookmarklet is unstable unless the latest version of [http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ HTML5 shiv] is used on the page to be outlined
  * *No easy way to actually drag'n'drop the bookmarklet*, unless there are proficient IE users, who can explain how it's done.
  * *Pointless for development process* as a bookmarklet - other browsers provide much better support. The full "library" version (minified JS) does work and will be maintained.
